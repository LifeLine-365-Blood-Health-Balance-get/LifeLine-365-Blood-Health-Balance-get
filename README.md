### Why Blood Health Matters

[LifeLine 365 Blood Health Balance](https://howdyscbd.com/lifeline-365-blood-health-balance-order/)  serves as the body’s transportation system, delivering oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and other essential substances to cells while carrying away waste products. Its role in maintaining homeostasis and supporting immunity is unparalleled. When blood health is compromised, it can lead to issues such as fatigue, weakened immunity, poor wound healing, and chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.
Maintaining healthy blood involves ensuring the proper production of red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets, as well as maintaining the right balance of nutrients like iron, vitamin B12, and folate. Additionally, blood health relies on optimal circulation and the ability to manage inflammation and clotting processes effectively.

### Factors Affecting Blood Health

Several lifestyle, dietary, and environmental factors influence blood health. These include:
1.	Nutritional Deficiencies: A lack of key nutrients like iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid can lead to anemia, fatigue, and reduced oxygen transport.
2.	Poor Diet: Excessive consumption of processed foods high in sugar and unhealthy fats can lead to chronic inflammation and increase the risk of cardiovascular issues.
3.	Lack of Physical Activity: Sedentary lifestyles contribute to poor circulation and an increased risk of blood clots and other cardiovascular problems.
4.	Chronic Stress: Prolonged stress can raise cortisol levels, which in turn may lead to increased blood pressure and inflammation.
5.	Toxins and Pollutants: Exposure to environmental toxins, including heavy metals and air pollution, can harm blood cells and impair overall function.
6.	Age: As we age, the production of blood cells in the bone marrow slows down, and circulation efficiency declines.
